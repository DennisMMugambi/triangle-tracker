## Description
This is a simple website with a form input that takes in 3 measurements from the user and returns the type of triangle that can be formed. The types of triangles are equilateral,scalene and isosceles. However if no triangle can be formed from the inputs I.e “if any two measurements entered added together are less than the remaining”, the user is notified correspondingly.

| Behavior our program should handle:| Input Example, when it receives| Output Example it should return     |
| :------------- | :----------: | -----------: |
| It rejects letters and values below 0 | a or -1   | Enter a value above zero  |
| It alerts the user if a triangle cannot be formed from the measurements, that is if the sum of any two sides is equal to or less than the third  | 2,3,7 | No triangle can be formed |
| It detects if an equilateral triangle can be formed |6,6,6 |The measurements you've entered form an equilateral triangle|
| It detects if an isosceles triangle can be formed|10,10,15|The measurements you've entered form an isosceles triangle|
| It detects if a scalene triangle can be formed|13,14,15|The measurements you've entered form a scalene triangle|
## Known Bugs
If for any reason upon the first click of the submit button the page does not give you any results, try clicking it once or twice more or refreshing the page, input your measurements and try again. It should be mentioned that sufficient testing has been conducted to ensure that the website works as expected and thus if your experience any abnormalities or defects kindly contact me via the contact details provided in the contact section below.
